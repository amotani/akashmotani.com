        The 6 Sleep Hacks You NEED!
      </h1>
      <div className="italic mt-6">
        Most of the information in this essay is derived from Matthew Walker's
        book, "Why We Sleep," and his podcast interviews.
      </div>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Sleep is the single most effective way to reset your brain and improve
        your body's health. This is not to dismiss the importance of exercise or
        diet, as both are critical for overall health. However, if you were
        deprived of food, exercise, or water for a day, compared to being
        deprived of sleep for a day and then having your brain and body
        impairments mapped, it's not even a competition how much more one night
        of lost sleep can hurt your body and brain. Sleep is the elixir of life
        and serves as your body's life support system.

        Why Do We Sleep?
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Have you ever asked yourself why we sleep? I had never even pondered
        this question before encountering the work of Matthew Walker. From an
        evolutionary perspective, sleep seems utterly pointless. While sleeping,
        you cannot forage for food, find a mate, care for your young, and worst
        of all, you are vulnerable to predation. However, sleep has evolved with
        life itself on this planet and has fought its way through the
        evolutionary path, suggesting that it must be essential at the most
        basic of biological levels.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Sleep is crucial for restocking the immune system and improving immune
        sensitivity. It also regulates blood sugar, appetite, and sex hormones
        like testosterone and estrogen. Additionally, sleep improves memory,
        reduces anxiety, emotional difficulties, and trauma. Furthermore, it
        cleanses Alzheimer's toxic proteins from the brain. These are just a few
        reasons why sleeping is essential.
      </div>
      <h1 className="font-bold tracking-tighter text-2xl mt-6">
        Unihemispheric Sleep
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        There are a few species that can sleep with one half of their brain
        while the other half is wide awake. One example is aquatic mammals like
        dolphins, who need to maintain mobility in the water and surface for
        air. Many avian species also exhibit unihemispheric sleep, where birds
        in the middle of a flock get to sleep with both halves of their brain,
        while those at the far ends sleep with one half of their brain. This
        allows the flock to have a 360-degree view of their surroundings for
        protection.
        <div className="m-2" />
        The wiring and architecture required for one half of the brain to be
        asleep while the other half is awake is incredibly complex, indicating
        that sleep is not dispensable or negotiable. If it were, evolution would
        have found a different way for species to reap the benefits of sleep
        without such intricate wiring. In other words, sleep is essential and
        cannot be avoided.

        Chronotypes - Effects of Humanity being a Tribe Species
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Now, there is something else that we call "your chronotype". Are you a
        morning type, evening type, or somewhere in between? And, by the way,
        you don't get to decide. It's about a third-split across the population.
        It's because we are in a tribe. If we all sleep at the same time, we are
        vulnerable for eight hours. We have the morning types who go to sleep
        from 9 pm to 5 am. Then, we have the extreme evening types who sleep
        from 2 am to 10 am. So, you're only vulnerable for 2 to 3 hours.
      </div>
      <h1 className="font-bold tracking-tighter text-2xl mt-6">
        What if I sleep with a partner who has a different chronotype?
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Let's say my partner goes to sleep at 9 pm and I go to bed at midnight.
        If she wakes me up as she's waking up at 5 am, it can cause non-trivial
        issues. Likewise, if I wake her up as I'm getting into bed, it can also
        be disruptive. Sleep difficulties or issues are often cited as a cause
        or contributing factor to breakups, with chronotype mismatch being one
        of the factors. Some dating profiles even mention whether someone is a
        morning or evening type to avoid potential issues.
        <div className="m-2" />
        A "sleep divorce" is when couples sleep in separate locations, which is
        a taboo topic but is actually quite common (one in four people sleep
        separately from their partner). Sleeping well can improve sex hormones
        and desire for intimacy, with extra sleep increasing a woman's libido by
        14%. However, objective measures show that couples actually sleep worse
        when sleeping together, despite subjective satisfaction being higher.
        <div className="m-2" />
        If you're considering a sleep divorce, be honest with yourself and your
        partner. You can try it out experimentally for a week or 10 days to see
        how it goes. The "bookends" of sleep (getting into bed and waking up)
        are what most couples miss, rather than the unconscious experience of
        sleeping together. You can still have a kiss or cuddle before retreating
        to separate beds.

        Modernity and Sleep
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Modern lifestyle is making it increasingly difficult for us to get
        enough sleep. Sleep is often thought of as a biological process, and it
        is, but it is also influenced by our environment. For example, when you
        ask someone how they slept last night, they might say they had to catch
        a flight, heard a noise, or their partner had to wake up early for a
        meeting. There are countless external factors that can affect our
        ability to sleep. From a capitalistic standpoint, society does not want
        us sleeping. From this perspective, we are expected to either produce or
        consume, and when we're sleeping, we're doing neither. In fact, CEO of
        Netflix, Reed Hastings, has said that they are committing a war against
        sleep.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Anxiety, caffeine consumption, and a lack of exposure to the right
        temperature cues are just a few factors that contribute to a sleep
        deprived society. Governments have launched public health campaigns
        related to smoking, drinking, obesity, safe driving, loneliness, mental
        health, and suicide, yet none have focused on sleep. Sleep is a
        fundamental ingredient and is intimately related to almost all of the
        issues mentioned above. Research has found that sleep is a precursor to
        suicidal thinking, planning, and completion. If governments prioritize
        sleep, the health benefits will have manifold consequences.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Sleep is the best form of physiologically injected venture capital you
        could ever wish for. Insufficient sleep costs most nations about two
        percent of their GDP. In America, this number amounts to 411 billion
        dollars of lost profit caused by insufficient sleep. Businesses need to
        prioritize the sleep of their employees.
        <div className="m-2" />
        NASA, in the 1980s, looked into using naps in their astronaut program.
        They found that a 26-minute nap can improve alertness by 54% and
        performance by 34%. This data was so powerful that it was transmitted to
        all the terrestrial workers, calling it the NASA nap. Today, Google and
        Facebook implement this practice, understanding the dollars and cents
        version of productivity.
        <div className="m-2" />
        In the case of business, if you don't snooze, you lose.
      </div>
      <h1 className="font-bold tracking-tighter text-2xl mt-6">Naps</h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Different stages of sleep serve different functions for the brain at
        different times of night. All stages are important and have their own
        specific functions. Naps that are less than 20 minutes are really
        beneficial, but if you nap for over 20 minutes, you start going into
        deeper stages, and if you wake up, you may feel miserable. Avoid napping
        too late in the afternoon, and if you suffer from insomnia, do not nap.
        Adenosine is a chemical that builds up in your brain as you stay awake,
        causing sleepiness, but naps clear it away completely.
        <div className="m-2" />
        If you struggle with sleep at night and nap during the day, you may
        reduce the amount of healthy sleepiness that builds up, which can
        negatively impact your chances of getting a good night's sleep.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Try not to nap after 2 pm.
      </div>
      <h1 className="font-bold tracking-tighter text-2xl mt-6">Caffeine</h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Caffeine can negatively affect your sleep in three ways. First, it has a
        half-life of about 5-6 hours and a quarter-life of 10-12 hours. If you
        drink coffee at noon, a quarter of it will still be in your brain at
        midnight. Second, caffeine is a stimulant that attaches to adenosine
        receptors, blocking the feeling of sleepiness. However, adenosine
        continues to build up, leading to a "tsunami wave" of sleepiness once
        the caffeine wears off, known as a caffeine crash. Third, caffeine can
        cause anxiety and interfere with deep sleep.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Deep sleep is critical for regulating your cardiovascular and metabolic
        systems, replenishing the immune system, and consolidating new memories
        in the brain. It also cleanses the brain of metabolic toxins, including
        those related to Alzheimer's disease.
        <div className="m-2" />

          Disclaimer: All suggestions and advice in this essay are based on
          scientific research on sleep. It does not advocate for a specific way

          tools to make informed decisions about sleep.

        While coffee has many health benefits, such benefits are not related to
        caffeine. Coffee beans contain a high amount of antioxidants. It is
        recommended to limit coffee intake to two or three cups in the morning.
        Alternatively, you can try switching to decaf.

        I’m lying in bed awake at 4am, what should I do?
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        If you find yourself lying awake in bed, it is recommended that you get
        out of bed after 30 minutes and go to a different room. You can read a
        book, listen to a podcast, or do some relaxing stretches. This will help
        your brain stop associating being awake with your bed, which will make
        it easier to fall asleep when you return to bed. Do not eat, work, or
        use your computer during this time. Doing so will signal to your brain
        to wake up.
        <div className="m-2" />
        If you prefer to stay in bed, you can try meditating. Some meditation
        apps offer sleep stories, or you can listen to story podcasts while
        sleeping. This can help take your mind off your worries and allow sleep
        to come naturally.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Another technique is to take yourself on a mental walk in high fidelity
        detail. This can help saturate your cognitive capacity, making it
        difficult for your anxieties to enter your mind.
        <div className="m-2" />
        It is important to avoid checking the time while lying awake in bed, as
        this can increase anxiety. Removing all clock faces from your bedroom
        can be helpful.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Finally, if you are unable to fall asleep, try to accept that tonight
        may not be your night. Instead of worrying about sleep and the next day,
        just lie down and rest. Enjoy a good rest without any pressure to fall
        asleep.
      </div>

        What happens when your sleep suffers?
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Performance, memory, relationships, and libido all suffer.
        <div className="m-2" />
        If someone is limited to 4-5 hours of sleep for one week, their doctor
        would classify them as prediabetic. They will age by 10 years, their
        blood pressure will creep up, and heart rate will increase. Diabetes,
        cardiovascular disease, mental health issues, anxiety, depression,
        suicidality, immune compromise, and infection can all happen in the
        midterm. In the longer term, there is a risk of premature mortality. The
        shorter you sleep, the shorter your life. The risk of cancer and
        Alzheimer’s increases. Research has shown that if you are sleepless for
        a night, there is an immediate increase in Alzheimer's disease-related
        proteins circulating in your bloodstream.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Your body has a cleansing system called the lymphatic system. Dr. Maiken
        Nedergaard discovered that the brain also has a cleansing system called
        the glymphatic system, which is only active during deep sleep. Sleep is
        a power cleanse for the brain that cleans the proteins that build up in
        our brains and cause Alzheimer’s disease.

        Effect of Technology on Sleep
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Blue light can delay the time it takes to fall asleep by up to two
        hours.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Smartphones and iPads are designed to capture your attention. This has a
        stimulating effect on your brain that makes it difficult to fall asleep.
        This phenomenon is known as sleep procrastination, where you may be
        sleepy but keep checking your phone, leading to sleep deficiency.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and it's not going
        away anytime soon. However, it's advisable not to take your phone into
        the bedroom. If you must, use it only while standing up. After about six
        or seven minutes, you'll likely feel the need to sit down and put your
        phone away.
      </div>
      <h1 className="font-bold tracking-tighter text-2xl mt-6">
        Sleep and Weight
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        Leptin and Ghrelin are hormones that regulate appetite. Leptin signals
        to your brain that you are full, while Ghrelin signals that you are
        hungry. When sleep is restricted to six hours, Leptin decreases by 18
        percent while Ghrelin increases by 28 percent. This creates a "double
        jeopardy" situation where you lose the signal that you are full and
        become much more hungry, leading to overeating.
        <div className="m-2" />
        Studies show that underslept individuals eat about three to four hundred
        extra calories at each meal, with heavy starchy carbohydrates, simple
        sugary foods, and salty foods being the most commonly consumed. Sleep
        deprivation also leads to increased activity in the reward centers of
        the brain, causing cravings for unhealthy foods. The impulse control
        centers of the brain are also affected during this time.
        Endocannabinoids, which control appetite, increase by 20 percent.
        Finally, if you do not get enough sleep and are in a calorie deficit, 60
        percent of the weight you lose will come from lean muscle mass.
      </div>
      <h1 className="font-bold tracking-tighter text-2xl mt-6">Dreaming</h1>
      <div className="mt-6">
        During deep sleep, memories are transferred from short-term to long-term
        storage. During REM sleep, individual pieces of information that we've
        been learning are interconnected and associated with our back catalog of
        stored information. Dream sleep creates a revised mind web of
        associations that is capable of solving previously impenetrable
        problems. Think of dreaming as informational alchemy, where things that
        shouldn't normally go together are fused together and result in marked
        advances in your thinking, productivity, and ingenuity. This way, you go
        to sleep with the pieces of the jigsaw, but wake up with the puzzle
        complete. I would argue that this is the difference between knowledge,
        which is remembering the individual pieces, and wisdom, which is knowing
        what it all means when you fit them together.
